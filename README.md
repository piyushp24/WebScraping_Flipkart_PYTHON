This project is a Flipkart Web Scraper built to extract product data from Flipkart's website. The scraper was implemented using Python and utilizes the following libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and storage.
Requests: For making HTTP requests to fetch web pages.
BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML content and extracting relevant data.
Features
Data Extraction: Scrapes product information such as names, prices, ratings, and more from Flipkart.
